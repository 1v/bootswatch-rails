## 0.3.0 (2013-01-13)

* Add a converter script for most of the repetitive less/sass conversion work
* Add bootswatch project as a submodule
* Add a rake task that auto-converts less files from submodule into scss
* Convert all latest bootswatches to scss
* Stop using percentage -> percentile conversion, it seems to only break things
